Terraform is an open source utility, created by the HashiCorp company, the
same company that created Vagrant, Packer, Consul, and other popular
infrastructure tools. It was initially released in July 2014, and since then, has
come a long way to become one of the most important tools for infrastructure
provisioning and management.
This is how Terraform is described by HashiCorp:
... a tool for safely and ef iciently building, combining, and launching
infrastructure. From physical servers to containers to SaaS products,
Terraform is able to create and compose all the components necessary to run
any service or application. (https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform.html).
